# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to **predict the presence of heart disease** in patients based on various health metrics. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in **early detection** and risk assessment using data-driven techniques.

## üìå Problem Statement

Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Early diagnosis can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project uses patient data to predict the likelihood of heart disease using classification algorithms.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview

- **Type:** Tabular, supervised classification dataset  
- **Target Variable:** `HeartDisease` (1 = presence, 0 = absence)  
- **Source:** Public health datasets / UCI repository / Kaggle (depending on your source)
